# Sticks.lua for TBS Mambo and Tango 2
 This is a simple but useful Lua script written for the TBS Mambo and Tango 2 radios. Inspired by Lee Schofield's (Painless360) video demonstrating OpenTx's ability to display model comments, the script's sole purpose is to simply provide a scrollable list of common stick commands for Betaflight, HDZero and INAV.  The script is intentionally simple so that non-programmers can feel free to tinker with it, add new sticks command, and otherwise improve it.

## Installation

Download and copy the `sticks.lua` script into your /SCRIPTS/TELEMETRY folder on your Mambo/Tango2.  Once copied, you can run the script one of two ways:

1. The preferred method is to add the script to your DISPLAY items, so it can be accessed much more quickly. To add it, click the Menu button to get into Model settings. Tap the Menu botton until you reach the DISPLAY tab. Select an empty row, set the type to SCRIPT, and then from the list of scripts choose `sticks`.  Once done, you can easily run the script by long pressing the Page button to bring up the scripts and tapping Page, which will cycle through the scripts you've set up. To exit the Telemetry screen, long press the Exit button.

2. Log press on the Menu button, click Page, scroll down to [SCRIPTS], then scroll down to [TELEMETRY], select sticks.lua, then long press the jog wheel and select Execute.


## Usage

Once you have the script running on your radio, use the jog wheel to scroll through the items. If you tap the menu button, the list will reset back to your starting point.

If you'd like to change the starting point, open the script in a text editor and look for the line near the top that says "local currentRow = 1". Simply change the value to one of three values:  1 for Betaflight, 14 for HDZero or 20 for INAV.  Save the file back to your radio and you're all set!

## Comments and Feedback

Constructive comments and feedback are always welcome. I'll try and keep the readme updated as changes occur.
